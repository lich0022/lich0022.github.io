I created my portfolio using Bootstrap. I did so because Bootstrap and I have a strong relationship, where as myself and custom CSS do not get along very often. I personally find Bootstrap the most enjoyable to use. I decided to create my portfolio of photography because it is one of my favourite passtimes/hobbies. At first I wasn't to sure exactly how to create it, mainly because I'm often shy when it comes to showing or displaying my own work. However, when I was going through what photos I did want to display on my portfolio, I ended up feeling proud to show them off, since I have incredibly happy with them, and proud of them.
