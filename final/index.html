                <p class="text-center">
                    I started getting interested in photography when I was in grade 10 or 11. I had mentioned being interested in it, so my parents bought my a camera for my birhday. My first picture with my camera was a picture of my dog, and that is when I truly realized just how much better the imagery was compared to my phone's camera.

                        <h4 class="text-center">Operating Grids</h4>
                        <p>I truly believe that photography is an amazing artform. It is a great way to express one's creativity and individuality. It is facinatiing that we have the ability to capture details with our certain cameras and lenses that we aren't able to see with the naked eye. Photography really captures the true beauty of the world, not matter what kinda of photo is being taken.</p>
